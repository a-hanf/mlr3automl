\format{[R6Class] AutoML}
\description{
base class for AutoML in mlr3automl. Has subclasses for Classification and Regression.
}
\section{Construction}{

```
AutoML$new(task)
```
}

\section{Internals}{

The AutoML class uses `mlr3pipelines` to create a GraphLearner. Then other stuff happens
}

\section{Fields}{

* `task` :: `Task` object from `mlr3` \cr
  Contains the data and some meta-features (like the target variable)
* `learner` :: `GraphLearner` object from `mlr3pipelines` \cr
  Contains the machine learning pipeline containing preprocessing steps and a `Learner` object
* `resampling` :: `Resampling` object from `mlr3tuning` \cr
  Contains the resampling method to be used for hyper-parameter optimization
* `measures` :: `Measure` object from `mlr_measures` \cr
  Contains the performance measure, for which we optimize during training
* `param_set` :: `ParamSet` object from `paradox` \cr
  Contains the parameter space over which we optimize
* `tuning_terminator` :: `Terminator` object from `mlr3tuning` \cr
  Contains the termination criterion for model tuning
* `tuner` :: `Tuner` object from `mlr3tuning` \cr
  Contains the tuning strategy used for hyper-parameter optimization (default: Random Search)
